LINQ: Language integrated query					-by NARESHIT (Bangarraju)
	->Using.System.Linq;	
	-> designed by Microsoft 3.5 fram work
	-> it is like (SQL  is query language in Data base) LINQ is query in C# dotnet framework ,it makes easy and efficient code written for application developer 
 without writing loops and large c# code simply we use LINQ query for getting output.

-Using LINQ we can write queries on a wide variety of data sources like Arrays,Collections,Database,Tables,DataSet's ,XML Data


Linq to Objects  :Arrays,Collections,etc.
Linq to Databases: Data Tables,Relational Database Tables
		  -Linq to ADO>Net
		  -Linq to Sql
		  -Linq to Entites

Linq to XML    :XML Files

linq: having syntaxex in c# format and we write it in c#

Linq to Sql:
------------

->It's a query language that is introduced in .Net 3.5 framework for working with relational database i.e.Sql Server.
->Linq to Sql is not only about querying the data but also allows us to perform Insert,Update operations also we call them as CRUD Operations.

CRUD:Create(Insert),Read(Select),Update,Delete		{Stored Procedures=CRUD Operations}

Note:we can also call stored procedures by using Linq to SQL.

->Already there is a language known as SQL using which we can interact with Sql Server with the help of ADO.Net.


SQL => SQL Server

1.Runtime Syntax checking of Sql Stmts.	[c# Aplications not run Sql Statements so we writes the sql statements in Double Quotes, in C#. these " coted" sql statmts executed by sql server runtime	or Syntax checking is the duty of SQL SERVER]
2.Not Type Safe.	[here we are know the column name,type before data inserting data in c#]
3.No Intellisense Support	[C# Application not shows SQL SERVER syntaxees for developer]
4.Debugging of Sql Stmts is not possible.	[c#,Sql Server worked so]
5.Code is a combination of Object Oriented and Relational.	[ex:"Insert Into Student Values("+textBox1.Text+",""+textBox2.Text+"')"; ]


LINQ => SQL Server

1.Compile-Time Syntax checking.		[Syntax checking is the duty of c# Application]
2. Type Safe.
3. Intellisense Support is Available.	[C# Application shows LINQ syntaxees for developer]
4.Debugging of Linq Sql is  possible.
5.Code is a Pure Object Oriented.	[ex:Insert Into Student Values textBox1.Text+,+textBox2.Text+); ]



IN LINQ :names

SQL				LINQ	

Table			=>	Class
Columns			=>	Property
Rows			=>	Instance
Stored Procedures	=>	Methods




LINQ  query Syntax:
----   ------------

from <alias> in <coll | arr> [<cluses>] select <alias>		[alias is optional,(clauses=where,groupby,having,orderedby)]
ex1: var brr=from i in arr select i;
ex2: var brr=from i in arr  where i>40 select i;
ex3: var brr=from i in arr where i>40 orderby i select i;
ex4: var brr=from i in arr where i>40 orderby i descending select i;
